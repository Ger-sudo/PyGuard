This is an antivirus i built completely in python using watchdog. Give it a try! Also dont expect the best antivirus its litterally puilt in python so yeah thats it!

INSTALLATION
pip install watchdog
git clone https://github.com/Ger-sudo/PyGuard.git
cd PyGuard
python PyGuard-X Advanced User UI.pyw
OR 
python PyGuard User Friendly UI.pyw
(sorry for the long names)
also you can just download the .pyw files and run them without any complications
last thing issue this if anybody needs a .exe version THANKS!
